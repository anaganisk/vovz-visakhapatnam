# VOVZ FS2020 package (Visakhapatnam Airport, India for Micorosft Flight Simulator 2020 enhancements)
VOVZ on airport is automatically generated on microsoft simulator and misses many features like lights, PAPI and ILS etc. Since I am from the city, I thought to enhance it a bit.

This repo is the project file for Airport Design editor used to enhance VOVZ.

Enhancements:
 - Airport lighting
 - ILS - 28 (111.10)
 - ATC Tower
 - Comms
 - PAPI

### Usage
Copy the vovz-visakhapatnam last child directory in the file tree into you community folder.
